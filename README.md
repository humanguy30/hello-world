Tutorial Repository

This is literally just a way to finish the tutorial and get a good feel for the features of GitHub

I'm Andy.  I am a Programming student who is getting over his head in a project for fun because why not learn outside the classroom.  I am doing this with another student, and we are both working on what may one day be called different features of the same Program.  So we needed a way to share code.  Enter GitHub.
